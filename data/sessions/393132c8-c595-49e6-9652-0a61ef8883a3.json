Deploying your FastAPI app with Docker is a smart move, as it helps ensure consistency across environments. \n\nHere's a quick outline to get you started:\n\n1. **Create a `Dockerfile`** in your project directory:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use an official Python runtime as the base image\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install dependencies\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy project files\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose the port FastAPI runs on (default 8000)\nEXPOSE 8000\n\n# Command to run your FastAPI app with Uvicorn\nCMD [\"uvicorn\", \"main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\"]\n```\n\n2. **Create a `requirements.txt`** listing your dependencies, e.g.:\n\n```\nfastapi\nuvicorn[standard]\nasyncpg\nsqlalchemy\npsycopg2-binary\n```\n\n3. **Build the Docker image:**\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t myfastapiapp .\n```\n\n4. **Run the container:**\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8000 myfastapiapp\n```\n\nThis will start your FastAPI app inside Docker, accessible on `localhost:8000`.\n\nIf you're using PostgreSQL, you might also consider using Docker Compose to orchestrate both your app and the database together, making deployment easier.\n\nWould you like an example `docker-compose.yml` for this setup?",
