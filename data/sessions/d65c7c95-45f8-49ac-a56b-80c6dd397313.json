      "content": "Great choice! Python with FastAPI is an excellent framework for building web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently. \n\nTo get you started, here's a simple example of a FastAPI app:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\n```\n\n### Steps to run this app:\n1. Save the code in a file, for example, `main.py`.\n2. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn (an ASGI server) if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install fastapi uvicorn\n   ```\n3. Run the app with:\n   ```bash\n   uvicorn main:app --reload\n   ```\n4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the message.\n\n---\n\nIf you need help with:\n- Creating routes\n- Handling request data\n- Connecting to a database\n- Authentication\n- Or any other feature\n\nJust let me know!",
